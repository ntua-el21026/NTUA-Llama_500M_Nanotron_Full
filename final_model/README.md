# Final Model Folder

This folder stores selected release-ready model-only exports.

## Included artifacts

- `stage3_12000_modelonly/`: Stage 3 bridge baseline export
- `sft_stage3_smoltalk_run1_5000_modelonly/`: final SFT export

These directories are intended for reproducible comparison between pre-SFT and post-SFT checkpoints.

Model files are stored in sharded weight format (e.g., `.safetensors`) together with configuration metadata.
